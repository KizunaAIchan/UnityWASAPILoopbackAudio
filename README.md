# UnityWASAPILoopbackAudio
A barebones example of WASAPI Loopback Audio in Unity using CSCore

Instructions:

1: Clone / download
2: Open in Unity
3: Play some music on your computer
4: Bang that "Play" button

That's it!

You won't see the bar analyzer until you hit Play - it's instantiated at runtime.
